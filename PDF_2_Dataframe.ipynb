      "by tramadol and/or nicotine sequentially augmented nuclear factor kappa B and the proinflammatory cytokine\n",

      "However, paradoxical to the boosted inflammation and apoptosis, heightened DA levels in the cortex parallel\n",
      "along with increased tyrosine hydroxylase in midbrain were apparent. Concomitant administration of tramadol\n",
      "and nicotine impaired spatial navigation in the Morris Water Maze test coupled with enhanced levels of acetyl-\n",

      "decreasing anxiety and aggression linked to chronic administration of nicotine, effects manifested by increased\n",
      "levels of serotonin and GABA. These results provide evidence that co-administration of tramadol and nicotine\n",

Butrylcholinesterase BuChE activity cortical supernatant was determined using butrylcholinesterase diag nostic kit purchased from Biodiagnostic Cairo Egypt according the method Knedel and Bottger 1967 Behavioral tests 261 Open field test OFT The open field test was performed according the method scribed Bailey and Crawley 2009 The square wooden arena high with red walls and white smooth polished floor that divided into grid equally sized areas lines drawn the chamber floor for visual scoring activity the experimenter The following parameters were recorded during the 5min observation period thigmotaxis time time spent the animal exploring the periphery the arena usually contact with the walls and corners central square frequency frequency with which the mice crossed with all four paws into the central square area iii ambulation fre quency number squares crossed the animal rearing fre quency number times the animal stood stretched its hind limbs with without forelimb support and vgrooming frequency number face scratching washing with the hind limbs and licking the forelimbs 262 Social interaction test Test was performed according the method described Niijima Yaoita 2013 The apparatus for the test was made clear polycarbonate 257 308 180 high After habituation for 30min the mouse tested was randomly assigned unfamiliar partner visitor mouse the same strain age and sex The pair unfamiliar mice was placed the apparatus for 10min and the total amount time spent active such sniffing grooming following and mounting well crawling over under the visitor mouse direct contact was recorded 263 Defensive aggression test Test was performed according the method described Johansson 2000 For the defensive aggression test the mouse was lifted its tail and placed Plexiglas cage 603141 high and allowed habituate for The reaction each mouse four different stimuli was then assessed wooden rod was slowly moved approach and touch the mouses snout response sniffs the rod

Individual animals were tested spatial version Morris Water Maze test according the method described Bromley Brits 2011 The maze consists large circular pool with diameter 150 and depth water maintained room temperature platform diameter was located the pool and concealed below the surface the water The platform was rendered invisible making the water opaque using powdered milk The water maze task was carried out the last week the periment Mice received five consecutive daily training trials the following days with each trial exhibiting cutoff time and trial interval approximately the mouse failed reach the escape platform within the maximally allowed time was guided with the help the experimenter and allowed remain the platform for The time reach the platform escape latency seconds was measured Memory consolidation test probe trial The time spent the target quadrant indicates the degree memory consolidation that has taken place after learning the probe trial the mouse

One plausible explanation for this observation might attributed the present enhancement cortical and GABA which have been shown previously impair memory function Fontana 1995 HosseiniSharifabad 2016

behavior addition improvement social interaction test compared mice subjected nicotine only However tramadol alone had effect defensive aggression social interaction tests Taken all together findings from the present study provide com pelling evidence for neurotoxic effects associated with coadministra tion tramadol and nicotine despite enhanced reward manifested increased and Indeed neurotoxicity mediated through crease oxidativenitrosative stress and enhanced levels via duction nNOS consequent increments GLU and iNOS down stream from NFκB TNFα leading neuroinflammation and last apoptosis Correlatively the neuroinflammation and Casp3 activation may contribute the memory deficits induced tramadol and nico tine However administration tramadol and nicotine improved social interaction
